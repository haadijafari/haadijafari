### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hadi Jafari

I got my diploma in Mathematics-Physics from Sempad schools. From that moment I realized my strong interest in Computer Science major, especially data analysis and Artificial Intelligence.
I learned the C programming language before I entered university, and this was my first sweet step in programming universe.

After entering Shahrekord University (Computer Science major as you can guess), I also learned C++ and Java at an intermediate level,
But along with the university classes and these two languages, due to my personal interest in AI, I started learning Python and became proficient in it.
As I was learning Python, I noticed the Django framework and after considering the options in front of me, I started learning it.
Now I am trying to gain experience and skills in this framework.

The next step is to become proficient in working with Databases and Machine Learning, which I am very eager to take.
I consider to have Image Proccessing in my road map as well, But this will be in relatively distant future!

- âš¡ Fun fact: University is a waste of time
